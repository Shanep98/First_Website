        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            After high school I went straight into a working enviorment and didnt know what I wanted to for a career. I started out small and searched for bigger and better opportunities. Once I had reached working at a call center and being around computers on a daily bases I realized that the machine infront of me connects people all across the world. From the old lady that needed help with a movie playing to the people I played games with once I got off work. It sparked a curiosity  that led me to learning python and looking for a career connecting more and more people.

            I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a ordered workspace and create a logical filing method so Iâ€™m always able to find what I need. Meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds has always intrigued me. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence.
